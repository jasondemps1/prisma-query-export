# Usage

## Connect to Prisma Cloud
To successfully pull data from Prisma Cloud utilizing this solution, you must create a `.env` file in the root directory. The contents should be as follows:

```
PRISMA_PCPI_NAME=""
PRISMA_PCPI_ID=""
PRISMA_PCPI_SECRET=""
PRISMA_PCPI_URL=""
PRISMA_PCPI_VERIFY=""
```

Failure to create this file and populate it correctly will prevent successful connection to Prisma Cloud and pulling data.
